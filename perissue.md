=> 1002 missing references for links found in 240 specifications

Any link to an external document from within a specification should trigger the creation of a corresponding entry in the references section.

Note Strudy only reports on links to "well-known" specs and ignores links to non-usual specs (e.g. PDF documents, etc.) for now.
